## 💻 Source Code - MIT App Inventor & Java

Welcome to the **Source Code** directory of this project!

This folder contains two versions of the code used in the project:

---

### 🧱 MIT App Inventor Block Code (✅ Real Logic)

* This is the **actual working logic** of the app.
* Created using **MIT App Inventor** blocks.
* You can import the `.aia` file and follow the block screenshots to understand the full functionality.

---

### ☕ Java Code (for Academic Use)

* This Java code is , written to reflect the same logic as the MIT blocks.
* It is only provided to satisfy **college project requirements**.
* The Java version follows the **same logic flow and structure** for presentation/documentation purposes.

## 🧩 How to Use a `.aia` File in MIT App Inventor

### 📌 What is a `.aia` file?

A `.aia` file is the **project source file** created by MIT App Inventor. It contains all the blocks, screens, media, and logic of your app.

### ✅ Steps to Import and Use the `.aia` File

#### 🔹 1. Go to MIT App Inventor

* Visit: [https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu)
* Login using your **Google account**.

---

#### 🔹 2. Start a New Project (Optional)

* You can skip this if you're directly importing.
* Otherwise, click **"Projects" → "Start new project"** if you want to create one manually.

---

#### 🔹 3. Import the `.aia` File

* Click on **"Projects"** in the top menu.
* Choose **"Import project (.aia) from my computer"**.
* Select the `.aia` file from your PC and click **OK**.

---

#### 🔹 4. Open the Imported Project

* After import, it will appear in your project list.
* Click on the project name to open it.
